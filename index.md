# Designing Dungeons

## Or, How to Kill a Party in 30 Rooms or Less

If you are hosting a fantasy adventure game, you own the act of creating dangerous environments, populating them with monsters, designing traps to be overcome, and hiding rewards. In short, you are the master of the dungeon. 

Creating a dungeon can seem daunting, but itâ€™s really just a series of small, discrete tasks. The act of creating a dungeon is actually fun for the Game Master and the discovery process is fun for the players. 

This course&mdash;**Designing Dungeons: Or, How to Kill a Party in 30 Rooms or Less**&mdash;is a series of discussions, practical examples, and exercises designed to walk new Game Masters through the process of creating a new dungeon from scratch. The course provides a hands-on approach to the act of dungeon writing in an attempt to demystify the process. By following along, you'll construct a dungeon for your players to explore.
