# Chapter 9: Exploring and Returning
{: .no_toc }

{: .note .callout}  
In this chapter, you'll think about the reasons your players have to explore and then return to your dungeon. You'll go through activities to [create a "treasure budget,"](#activity-create-a-treasure-budgetactivity) thinking through some interesting loot that tells a story about your setting's lore. Then, you'll telegraph the risks and rewards of your dungeon through [hooks and rumors](#activity-write-bounties-activity).

# Incentives to exploration

Thus far in this course, you have written [traps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter6/#traps-and-hazards), [monsters]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter7/#monsters), [secret hiding places]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter6/#secret-doors), and [dungeon lords]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter8/#dungeon-lords). What are all these hazards hiding? What are all these creatures hoarding? 

Provide good reasons for adventurers to brave all of these dangers! This will include treasures mundane and magical, but can also include non-tangible rewards. We'll discuss both in this chapter.

One of the most powerful incentives for exploration is an appeal to a character's backstory. Link an adventurer's personal quest, their goals, their vendettas, or their personal history to the dungeon. Your players will love it. 

You'll broadcast these incentives to the players using [rumors](#writing-rumors) and [hooks](#writing-hooks-and-bounties).[^1]

# Non-tangible rewards

Plot is always one incentive players have to go on adventures. Fight the bad guy, avert the ritual, rescue the princess. These are all perfectly reasonable reasons to explore.

Some rewards are a result of players figuring out how to best use [dungeon features]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter6/#dungeon-features). Dungeon features are sometimes explicitly beneficial: a pool that removes curses or a shrine that confers blessings. Sometimes, these are just weird effects that players learn to twist to their advantage: a gigantic forge they use to dispose of skeletons or destroy a cursed ring.

Other reasons to explore can be somewhat abstract. The players can pursue certain quests to raise their standing with a faction, prove their worth to a certain NPC, or get information about a larger goal. 

# Writing interesting treasure

A dungeon also benefits from having some tangible benefits: proof that you came, you saw, you conquered.

Extracting treasure is one of the open-ended challenges in dungeon crawling. How will the players safely make it out with their loot? Forefront this tension by making treasure that is interesting in and of itself: 

* Treasure that has a value inside the dungeon: a resource needed by a certain NPC or faction  
* Treasure that provides a hint for puzzles or traps  
* Treasure that is difficult to extract because its large, unwieldy, or fragile

Provide a good mix of treasure in your dungeon: coinage, precious gems, pieces of art, historical artifacts, trade goods. The variety will create an interesting texture to the adventure, and nod towards "realism."[^2] <img src="../../assets/images/foraging-by-bertdrawsstuff.png" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; max-width: 62%;"> 

[^2]:        
    Perfect realism in a fantasy adventure game is unattainable. Nods towards realism help maintain a level of the suspension of disbelief. 

Treasure can include harvestable reagents and ingredients. These can be naturally occurring, like useful herbs and fungi growing in a particular area. These can also be part of your [monstrous ecology]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter7/#step-6-monster-with-resources-you-can-harvest): an umberhulk's eyes can be sold as jewels, the venom of a basilisk can be extracted and used by the thief, the brains of an imp can be eaten to learn a new spell.

Use treasure to show off your [lore]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter6/#dungeon-lore). Art pieces might depict the scene of a historical event. Coins might have the faces of long-dead rulers depicted on them. Books might serve as Rosetta Stones that allow the translation of a forgotten language.

For example: Consider the magic swords held by the trolls in *The Hobbit*. The trolls did not make them, but stole them from other thieves. The swords have names (Orcrist! Glamdring! so cool) and a history dating back to the First Age, where they were forged for a war now forgotten by everyone except Elrond.

> There are lots of times during a game when players are half-listening, or thinking about other things, or maybe just wandering into the kitchen to get a soda. But in the magical post-combat pre-treasure window, everyone’s attention is high, their curiosity is piqued, and they are clamoring to hear what you will say next.  
>   
> You want to show the players something? Put it in the form of treasure. Want to tell them about the history of the elves? Tell it through treasure. Want to tell them about the cult in the area? Tell it through treasure. Want them to give them a clue about the dangers that are three doors down? Tell it through treasure.[^3]

[^3]:    
    [Treasure Tells A Story](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/99/treasure-tells-a-story/)

Museums are great sources of inspiration. Museums remind us that the real world is stranger than fiction, with cultural artifacts running a wider gamut than any RPG writer could dream up. In a recent visit to a museum, I found treasures such as:

* A torque used as a trading currency in the Yoruba culture (Nigeria, Republic of Benin)  
* A silver *kovsh* (traditional Russian drinking vessel) made by the Fabergé firm (Russia)  
* Shabits, small mummy-like figures designed to serve the entombed in the next world (Egypt, New King, Dynasty 18)  
* Cloak of duck feathers (modern, using traditional Mattaponi methods)

The only caveat is to not make things "too" interesting. Like with everything, there's a need for balance. You have your players' attention when you describe treasure: you'll lose it when the description becomes a monotonous list of fifty pieces of (otherwise interesting) art they find in a single room. If museums are a good touchstone, let each treasure room in your dungeon be a museum, highlighting two or three pieces at a time.

> A good method to create something that feels fresh but understandable is to take something normal and "twist" it.

## Magical treasure

How many magic items you provide your players sets the tone of your campaign setting. 

When rare, the campaign setting feels more grounded and realistic. Although, when distributed in a stingy manner, players can feel that a "realistic"[^2] campaign is really just a slog where they can never catch a break.

When common, magic items provide the feeling that the world is fantastic or reflective of folklore, where miller's sons find magic swords and old hermits in the wood are willing to dispense special charms against evil. Conversely, a myriad of magic can somewhat cheapen the experience of enchantment. "Ho hum, another magic sword."

>   
> One of the most prolific and gameable blogs is [d4Caltrops](https://blog.d4caltrops.com), which is loaded with d100 tables for all sorts of things. It can be an invaluable tool for you as you create your dungeon. Importantly, many of these are tables of treasure, equipment, and [magic items](https://blog.d4caltrops.com/search/label/magic%20items). Use them if you need inspiration during this chapter!

The best magic items play with contrasts, balancing these concerns.

Items of least enchantment might be somewhat common. These items have strange properties that make them interesting to use and solve problems in unique ways. These might also have a limited number of uses, letting them drop in and drop out of the campaign quickly. 

More powerful magic items can be rare to emphasize their specialness. Like [interesting treasure](#writing-interesting-treasure), these should be grounded in the history of your world. The best magic items are a mix of boons and banes: strong effects tempered by certain drawbacks. For example: a magic sword that deals great damage but must feed on blood every time it's drawn. A fight against a skeleton will provide no blood. If used in such a combat, the player must be careful to feed the sword a bit of their own blood, or the sword will find a way to drink its fill.

Such magic items are also a good [reason to experiment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter5/#a-reason-to-experiment), with players needing to test the artifact out in different situations to understand the full extent of its powers.

# How much treasure should you put into a dungeon?

Like [stocking monsters]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter7/#calibrating-threat), stocking treasure will vary a lot based on the game system that you're running. A game like OD&D cares more about a budget for treasure in a dungeon than it strictly does about monsters because treasure is how you level up. In future editions, this consideration is mostly inverted.

{: .josh }   
In [*His Majesty the Worm*](https://hismajestytheworm.games/), both your treasure and monster budget can be a little messy. Characters can (should) have lean times and surplus times. Ideally, characters should get a lot of treasure, go back to the City, spend all of it, and go back into the Underworld broke and penniless. This parallels the life cycles of stories like Conan or Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, who regularly win fabulous riches and begin most stories with empty pockets. A lot of mechanics in the game are there to enforce this genre convention.

Without getting into the specifics of numbers, here is a procedure to create a budget for treasure to place in your dungeon.

Imagine you are going to rate your adventurers from rank F to rank S. 

* Use your system's baseline to guide how much treasure your players should get for exploring the entire level in an ideal state. Set that total at rank A: good, but not superlative.   
* In rank F, players don't engage with anything in the dungeon, run from room to room, don't explore, never solve any puzzles, never press their luck.   
* In rank S, they essentially clear the dungeon level, find every secret door, loot every chest, kick every monster's ass. 

As you place treasure room by room, place enough treasure for players to achieve rank A if they play thoughtfully. Put 20% extra treasure into places where your have the highest difficulty: [secret rooms]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter6/#secret-doors), [puzzles]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter6/#puzzler-doors), and [dungeon lords]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter8/#dungeon-lords). 

For example, in OD&D, if you expect your party to level up after every dungeon, put enough gold for them to gain the next level in the "main path" of the dungeon. Then, add 20% extra treasure hidden in secret caches, guarded by particularly dead traps, and harvestable reagents inside the dungeon lord's skull.

Because you expect your players to be able to skip some things and miss some hidden clues, it will generally come out in the wash. By finding most of the treasure, players will get what they need to feel rewarded for their exploration.

## Calculating treasure for old-school games

{: .warren }  
Through the lens of systems employing 1 GP = 1 XP, you might need a little more hardline as to the amount of treasure. Also, if you are trying to convert an older TSR module or new OSR module to a dungeon-crawling system that doesn’t track advancement via coin, it might be helpful to understand what could be a significant amount of treasure that could constitute an "advancement unit." Here's a section that does the number crunching.

Here are steps, in brief, to calculate the amount of treasure (and dungeon size) required for leveling:

First, on average, 1-in-5 (1-4 on a d20) dungeon rooms contain treasure. 

Second, a level 1 room/monster/trap containing treasure that has an average value of 600GP. 

Third, 2000XP is the average XP needed to advance a PC from level 1 to 2. 8000XP is required to level a party of four from level 1 to level 2. 

Finally, the number of treasure rooms required to level a party from 1 to 2 determines the size of the dungeon, assuming 1GP = 1XP.  

So 8000XP (total party requirement to level) divided by 600GP (average GP per treasure room) = 13.3 treasure rooms which are found at a 1 to 5 ratio to normal rooms, so 13.3 times 5 equals ~66 total rooms.

"But wait, this series is about killing your PCs in only 30 rooms, not 66!" Correct. So this means two things. Either you increase the number of 30-room dungeons or increase the dungeon level to account for greater treasure value. Fortunately treasure room value scales with dungeon level: 600GP x [Dungeon Level] to keep pace with old-school PC leveling.

# What work is treasure doing?<span class="label label-green">Theory<span>  
{: .d-inline-block }

Treasure incentivizes some of the core loops of exploration-focused adventure gaming. Treasure is the lure that tempts smart players into dangers that they would otherwise avoid entirely. When tracking encumbrance, treasure provides an interesting choice of what tools and resources adventurers give up to make room for their filthy lucre. Exploration carries the thrill of pushing your luck, as players take risks to go deeper into the dungeon to maximize their  rewards.

And when the adventurers return to civilization, finding the right buyer for the different kinds of treasure they have to sell can be a problem-solving challenge in its own right.

# Activity: Create a treasure budget<span class="label label-purple">Activity</span>
{: .d-inline-block }

In this activity, you will brainstorm a variety of treasures and other rewards. This will be your treasure plan that you will use when you begin to populate your dungeon. In chapters 11-13, spend this budget to populate individual challenges with rewards. 

**[Open the workbook]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter2/#activity-create-a-theme-and-background-activity)** that you created in chapter 2. Navigate to page 10: **Treasure and Rewards**. For each step, write your answers down here.

For each question, fill out the following details:

* **Loot**: Give the loot a memorable name.  
* **Location**: Based on your previous work, you'll probably already have some ideas of where this treasure might be hiding. If you don't know yet, leave the **Location** sections blank for now.  
* **Description**: Write a short but evocative description of the object. Make each sentence punch!  
* **Special Effects**: If the item has a special property or magical power, use this space to describe how it works.

{: .important .callout}    
> Do the calculations for treasure that your system needs as part of your work in this activity to make sure you're achieving the goals of your game.  
>   
> Because you already set some treasure into the [dungeon lord's lair]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter8/#step-7-determine-treasure), include those in your reckoning for this activity.

## Step 1: Piece of art that tells a story
{: .no_toc }

Write a description of a valuable art piece that **tells the story** of your setting or dungeon level.

{: .note-title .callout}   
> Example:  
>   
> * tapestry that depicts the ancient treaty of elves and dwarves (worth 200g)  
> * mural that shows the Sea Lords demanding tribute (the gems in the chests in the mural are real - pry them out to collect 500g in mixed precious stones)  
> * copper armband shaped like a wolf biting its own tail, given by orcs as a betrothal gift (worth 80g)

## Step 2: Treasure that's hard to loot
{: .no_toc }

Write a description of something valuable that's **hard to loot**: something heavy, unwieldy, fragile, or embedded.

{: .note-title .callout}   
> Example:  
>   
> * chalcedony statue of angel worth 800g, but weighs 1,000 lbs  
> * glass sword worth 500g, but suffering a single point of damage while carrying it will destroy the sword to useless glass shards  
> * sarcophagus of the Sea Lord worth 500g to an antiquarian, but requires four hands to carry out of the dungeon

## Step 3: Harvestable loot 
{: .no_toc }

Write a description of something useful or sellable that needs to be **harvested**: animal, vegetable, or mineral.

{: .note-title .callout}   
> Example:  
>   
> * pyrotechnic fungus explodes when introduced to fire; 2d4 uses always found in room 128  
> * slimes can be rendered into potions; each slime you defeat can be carried in a hermetic jar and sold to the Alchemist's Guild for 50g a piece  
> * dungeon sloth pelts can be sold for 80g a piece

{: .highlight-title .callout}   
> Power level of your setting  
>   
> As you work through this exercise, consider your setting's tolerance for the magical. For fantastic settings, some of this loot might be magical. For more grounded settings, they can be mundane but useful: medicinal, alchemical, or reactive.

## Step 4: Consumable loot
{: .no_toc }

Write a description of something **useful but has limited uses**.

{: .note-title .callout}   
> Example:  
>   
> * tablet of holy writ functions as *scroll of protection* if read aloud (sellable for 50g if unused)  
> * 3 potions of levitation   
> * if freed, the djinn will perform one lesser wish for the adventurers

## Step 5: Enchanted item
{: .no_toc }

Write a description of **something magical**. **Associate** the magic item with the story of your setting and your dungeon lore.

{: .note-title .callout}   
> Example:  
>   
> * the silver hand of St. Ymily the Opener is a relic of the Pluraltine religion, grants the spell [*knock!*](https://www.themerrymushmen.com/product/knock-1-tmm/) to any true adherent once per day (worth 300g in raw silver, worth 10,000g or large writ of indulgence from the church)  
> * a wig of living hair; will bond to the user's head and serve as replacement hair - a cure for baldness! (cursed, attracts clowns)  
> * +1 staff of oak topped with a carven owl - owl will animate once per month and return with rare rumors from the Parliament of Owls

## Step 6: Treasure that creates a sense of wonder
{: .no_toc }

Take a normal, standard piece of treasure. Then **write a twist** for that treasure that makes it feel fresh and **wonderful**.

{: .note-title .callout}   
> Example:  
>   
> * rubies originally harvested from fire beetles deep under the earth  
> * jade statues made to honor dogs who have passed, each marked with a name: Brave, Bark-Destroys-Evil, Face-Licker  
> * coins minted with the face of the Last Emperor; to bear his sigil is illegal, making them hard to spend

# Returning to the dungeon

There's a thrill when not every beat of a story is perfectly gettable. The reader pauses and thinks, "I'll come back to this later." When used sparingly, the entire flow is enriched. An adventure is the same way.

We have already touched on some [reasons to return]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter5/#step-8-a-reason-to-return) in previous chapters:

* Returning to solve optional puzzles when you have an "aha" moment  
* Returning to fight the dungeon lord once you've done research and preparation  
* Returning to benefit from dungeon features that you've unlocked

Exploration-focused games are improved when filled with these little loops. Getting treasures, returning to town, returning to the dungeon, finding new threats, being defeated by a trap, learning how to bypass the trap, using the trap against an enemy, and so on. These cycles represent a sense of accomplishment and mastery over things that were once dangerous.

<img src="../../assets/images/lair-by-bertdrawsstuff.png" style="max-width: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

{: .warren }   
> **Money, Fame, & Power**: I think from an old-school perspective, one has to be careful about making a dungeon about a singular thing. This is because once that thing is accomplished, the dungeon loses its purpose in the wider campaign—it has been beaten or "100% cleared." Now what has happened is that a lot of creative effort has gone down the drain as the location has the potential to not be visited again. This is also where special rooms and empty rooms come in handy.  
>  
> I recommend thinking of the dungeon as an interesting place whose multifaceted rewards touch on money, fame, and power to various degrees. [^4]  While these are rather base, old-school PCs are often looking for some manifestations of all of those things, and for better or worse, IRL we are looking for those things too.

[^4]:   
    The Lonely Mountain is one such example. It was the location of a vast hoard (money), a seat of a dwarven kingdom (fame), and contained the Arkenstone (power)—so more than just a place Smaug was waiting.

## Cleared dungeons

A cleared dungeon is a kind of [non-tangible reward](#non-tangible-rewards). Allow dungeons to stay cleared to give players a sense of accomplishment and progression: they're meaningfully reducing the dangers of the world by adventuring. By defeating the bandits of the forest keep, they've reopened a trade route with the wood elves. By defeating the kobolds of the upper mines, they've permanently made it easier to plumb the depths of Mount Dread.

## Before/after state

Contrastingly, a cleared dungeon might not be "safe," just different. The bandits are cleared from the forest keep, but the players opened the sarcophagus in the basement and unleashed the Locust Lich into the world. Now, the forest is denuded, and a new danger is at hand.

Use before/after states to keep spaces that players often travel continuously interesting. Players can retread familiar ground and be surprised at the impact of their choices on the world around them.

## Restocking

Restocking creates the feeling that your dungeon is alive and dynamic. While unobserved, the mythic underworld's gears turn. If an ogre is slain, a hidden room looted, or a rusty trap sprung, replace those entries with something new.

Without getting too into "running the dungeon" instead of "designing the dungeon" (and killing your party in 30 rooms or less), I advocate for spending an afternoon between games restocking the dungeon at the following speedbumps: 

* Whenever the adventurers retreat after a very short adventure (a "five minute adventuring day")  
* Whenever the adventurers return to civilization

Ask yourself: How has the dungeon been changed by the player’s actions? Factions will refill their posts. Other factions will move into cleared rooms. Other adventurers will meet with success or failure. Revisit your random encounter tables (more on this in chapter 13) and replace any entries that the players have already encountered. 

{: .josh }  
**Don't restock treasure (maybe)**: Treasure is one of the things that should have diminishing returns as the dungeon restocks. As treasure is stripped away, players are incentivized to delve deeper and deeper to afford their adventuring lifestyle. Elsewise, players will often just linger in the uppermost reaches of the Underworld, and long-term megadungeon campaign play can stagnate. As with everything, let your taste and good sense guide you here.

# Writing hooks and bounties

Rumors, hooks, and bounties all exist outside the adventure itself. They are the tendrils the dungeon extends out into the wide world to tempt and tantalize unsuspecting adventurous types into itself.

**Hooks**[^5]  are a tool to broadcast the incentives for exploration. They are the reason that adventurers descend into dark places and brave untold perils. 

[^5]:    
    They are, to pursue the metaphor, the wriggling worm that baits the fish to take a bite. Perhaps hooks should be called "worms" instead? 

<img src="../../assets/images/transfer-by-bertdrawsstuff.png" style="float: left; margin: 15px 15px 10px 10px; max-width: 50%;"> Published modules often have a list of hooks—a concession by the designer to try and summarize the reasons to explore they've buried in the adventure in a d6 table format. We are not creating a module for publication here, just a module for you and your friends. This gives you an enormous advantage. 

Don't create a randomized list of hooks. Instead, promote your reasons to explore in a context that appeals to your players. If there is a knight in your party, one of the treasures you hide might be the lost relic of a noble knight of old. Your draconic dungeon lord can be the same dragon that killed your dwarf player's father. 
<br>
<br>
Use hooks to make the dungeon delving experience feel personal. Tie the rewards of the dungeon to the adventurers' overarching goals or their backstories. 

A **bounty** is just a hook that someone is paying the adventurers to pursue. "Yon dungeon has a flask that is good to get" is a hook. "Go into yon dungeon to get ye flask for me, I shall give ye 100 gold for it" is a bounty. 

Bounties are one of the ways your players have to get rewards. Factor bounties into your [treasure budget](#how-much-treasure-should-you-put-into-a-dungeon). 

Use bounties to make players feel like mercenaries taking jobs, oblige them to go into dangerous dungeons that they'd rather not explore on their own, and allow them to make a little extra cash for pushing their luck.

# Writing rumors

Rumors are informational details about the contents, inhabitants, and history of the dungeon that players can discover before they begin the adventure. Rumors allow players to make some informed decisions during the preparatory stage of delving: what equipment to pack, what spells to prepare, what approach to take.

Rumors are a good source for [clues]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter6/#cluestheory), providing hints at details that are hidden, easy to miss, or potentially confusing.

Rumors are also a tool to set the tone of the adventure before the players even get there. Hearing the legends of Ivar the Blood-drinker let the [themes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/chapter2/#theme-and-background) of your dungeon play out in your players' heads with anticipation while they're still safe in town.

Rumors can also be a [reason to return](#returning-to-the-dungeon). They can provide context for players that something was missed or left incomplete. 

In contrast to hooks, I think rumors are fun to randomize. A random rumor table allows you to create rumors ranging from unhelpful to extremely helpful, then let the dice decide what the players learn. Create a rumor table to provide an edge of chaos to the way players collect information in preparation for an expedition. 

Use rumors to provide a reward for players who do a little reconnaissance before they begin delving, establish some baseline facts about the dungeon, and provide clues to help players interact with hidden details.

<img src="../../assets/images/bottom-corner-c.png" style="max-width: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

## False rumors<span class="label label-green">Advice<span>
{: .d-inline-block } 

Historically, rumors in D&D have ranged from outright false to bizarrely candid. Here is why I think false rumors are a poor inclusion in your game.

I've said it many times during this course, but it bears repeating: games are interesting because they give interesting choices to the players. Rumors are a way to broadcast information to players about things their characters haven't discovered yet, which helps frontload the interesting choices they have to make.

Because of that, use false rumors sparingly, if at all. Players can't determine the reality of rumors until they enter the dungeon. When rumors are false and believed, the repercussions for adventurers can be dire. After that happens once or twice, a "once bitten twice shy" effect happens for players. Rumors are no longer meaningful ways to give hints about the dungeon and broadcast information: they're lies told by the GM to ensnare unwitting players. Rumors now have the opposite of their intended effect. 

This isn't to say you can't have partially true rumors or rumors with distorted facts. But, like good riddles, partially true rumors should be obvious in retrospect. "Aha, they said that this cave was haunted by ghosts, but it was really just Old Man Cooter dressing up as a ghost to scare away the locals!" 

{: .warren }   
**False rumor alternative: untrustworthy NPCs**: When a group of strangers roll into town looking for a big score, it's not going to be the law-abiding, good people who first approach this band of armed, taboo-breaking weirdos looking to desecrate snake-folk ruins. It's going to be people of dubious morals looking for scapegoats and fall-guys. Here hooks, rumors, and objectives can still be communicated and are found in the dungeon, but the consequences remain unclear to players.

# Activity: Write bounties <span class="label label-purple">Activity</span>
{: .d-inline-block }

In this activity, you'll write six bounties or hooks to call your players to adventure. You might imagine that each bounty is a posting on an adventurer's job board. Alternatively, the source of the bounty might be an established NPC, quest giver, or mentor for your players. 

If six hooks/bounties feels like a lot, you do not have to use all of them in your game. As with many of these activities, having many ideas and sorting through to find the good ones is our goal today.

Navigate to page 29: **Hooks, Rumors, and Bounties**. You'll use this page for both this activity and the next. For each step, write your answers down here.

**Write a sentence** or two for each of the following prompts:

## Step 1: Fetch quest
{: .no_toc }

# Activity: Create a rumor table<span class="label label-purple">Activity</span>
{: .d-inline-block }

Next, you'll write six rumors that players can potentially hear about your dungeon.

**Write a sentence** or two for each of the following prompts:

1. Write a rumor about a **monster** the players can encounter  
2. Write a rumor about a **trap**   
3. Write a rumor about **something an NPC wants or gives**  
4. Write a rumor a **treasure** the players can find

## Wrapping up  
{: .no_toc }

Between chapters 6 and 9, you've been checking off your [dungeon checklist]({{site.baseurl}}docs/chapter5/#what-makes-a-good-dungeon): your reasons to explore, talk, fight, flee, breathe easy, experiment, be surprised, and return. Great job! Your players are going to have so much fun because of your hard work. 

In the final chapters of this course, you'll start placing your ideas onto your map and connecting them together.

## What are some good magic items that I can place in my dungeon?  
{: .no_toc }

> Tiny tree.  Produces three fat apples every day (enough to feed 1 person).  Must be watered with 1 cup of blood each day, or it will die.  If dead, can be revived with water.  Probably found dead/in a chest.

Arnold K. at Goblinpunch has written [100 Minor Magical Items](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/01/d100-minor-magical-items.html), which are great for any old-school style adventure game. Combine them with his [Perfect Potion List](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-perfect-potion-list.html) and you have enough magic items to populate several dungeons.

## How do you make "common" magic items feel unique?  
{: .no_toc }

> First things first. The standard treasure lists found at the back of your DMG are about as flavorful as a saltine cracker soaked in room-temperature water.  
>   
> This is boring: “You find a +1 longbow."  
>   
> This is much cooler: “You find an elven bow made of yew and strung with a strand of elf hair."

OK, allow me to cite my own work on this subject. I have found that the "standard" magic items of the classic D&D experience don't have the appeal of magic items in fantasy fiction because they reduce the wonder of enchantment to just another +1 on my character sheet. In my main blog, I provide a metric for "active, fantastic magic". Check out the [article here.](https://riseupcomus.blogspot.com/2023/01/making-1-swords-feel-magical.html) 

## When should I restock a dungeon (if at all)?   
{: .no_toc }

> My basic principle, the one underlying everything else that I'm going to talk about, is that restocking a dungeon should be less complicated than simply coming up with an entirely new dungeon or dungeon zone.

In [Considerations on Restocking Dungeons](https://retiredadventurer.blogspot.com/2017/02/considerations-on-restocking-dungeons.html), John at RetiredAdventurer lays out some first principles for what should trigger the restocking exercise for old-school dungeons. This includes a very cool "theme table" idea to help guide the process of restocking.

## How do I quickly restock a large dungeon?  
{: .no_toc }

> Roll 1d6  
> 1 Monster  
> 2 Monster and Treasure  
> 3-6 Empty (1 in 6 chance of concealed treasure)  
> I really like this table because it mechanizes the process of keeping a megadungeon "alive," which is, I think, a key feature that distinguishes it from smaller, "lair" type dungeons.

Old-school D&D thrills in an i-Ching-esque adherence to meaning through randomization. James Maliszewski at Grognardia uses a [random restocking procedure](https://grognardia.blogspot.com/2012/04/dungeon-restocking-and-rival.html) to infuse a sense of chaotic realism into what occurs in a dungeon when the players are away. The procedure includes rival adventuring parties, adding an interesting layer to the game world.

## Where's the nuance on false rumors and partially true rumors?  
{: .no_toc }

> The internal logic of Rumors allows partial truths and inconsistencies - a Rumor that is self-contradictory or oracular suggests its listener needs to be cautious about its contents or interpret them. Likewise a rumormonger that appears untrustworthy, sounds unhinged, or is obviously a disreputable narrator allows the designer more leeway to create ambiguous Rumors as this also cautions the players.

Gus L., our oft cited friend, talks about rumours in his article [Dungeon Crawl Practice 2 - Rumor Tables](https://alldeadgenerations.blogspot.com/2020/02/dungeon-crawl-practice-2-rumor-tables.html). He expounds further on why he doesn't use purely false rumours and how you can finesse levels of truthiness in your rumour table.
